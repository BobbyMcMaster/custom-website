<p>Here you will find some of the projects I have created using various computing
  languages.</p>

<h3>Binary Tree Visualizer</h3>

  <p>This project uses java and a JFrame to create an interactive binary tree.
    The user can input any set of numbers and the program will correctly display
    what the tree should look like. The program also displays the size and depth of
    the tree. You can see how this project was implemented by checking out the
    repository <a href="https://github.com/BobbyMcMaster/Binary-Tree-Visualizer" target="_blank">
    here.</a></p>

<h3>Black Jack game</h3>

  <p>Using Java, me and my partners successfully implemented a blackjack game.
    The program consists of various classes that each execute a certain aspect
    of the game. You can see how this project was implemented by checking
    out the repository here:</p>

<h3>Python Calculator</h3>

  <p> Using Python, I created a calculator that can be executed through a user's terminal.
    It is capable of executing all basic operations as well as calculating the remainder.
    The repository for this project can be found here:</p>

<h3>Is Prime Calculator</h3>

  <p> Program that takes a given file of integers and calculates whether each given
    number is prime or composite then displays the results to the user in the terminal.
    The repository for this project can be found here:</p>

<h3>Riemann-Sum Calculator</h3>

  <p> This program calculates the reimman sum of a given coordinates of a graph.
    This program will take user input and then calculate the area under the given
    coordinates of the graph and then will also display the graph that the user entered.

<h3>Brute Force Algorithm</h3>

  <p> This program uses the brute force algorithm to scan a piece of given text for
    a phrase that the user inputs and then returns its position to the user if a match
    is found. The repository for this project can be found here:</p>
