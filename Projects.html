<p>Here you will find some of the projects I have created using various computing
  languages.</p>


<h3>Black Jack game</h3>

  <p>Using Java, me and my partners successfully implemented a blackjack game.
    The program consists of various classes that each execute a certain aspect
    of the game. You can see how this project was implemented by checking
    out the repository here:</p>

<h3>Python Calculator</h3>

  <p> Using Python, I created a calculator that can be executed through a user's terminal.
    It is capable of executing all basic operations as well as calculating the remainder.
    The repository for this project can be found here:</p>

<h3>Is Prime Calculator</h3>

  <p> Program that takes a given file of integers and calculates whether each given
    number is prime or composite then displays the results to the user in the terminal.

<h3>Riemann-Sum Calculator</h3>

  <p> This program calculates the reimman sum of a given coordinates of a graph.
    This program will take user input and then calculate the area under the given
    coordinates of the graph and then will also display the graph that the user entered.
