    <p>Here you will find some of the projects I have created using various computing
      languages.</p>


    <h3>Cars.com Web Scraper</h3>

      <p>This project uses the python programming language and the beautiful soap library to scrape
        a cars.com website listing that is entered by the user. Once the URL is entered the website
        is scraped and the information is exported to an xls file and uploaded to the designated
        dropbox folder. The repository for this project can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/RobertMcMaster/Cars.com-Web-Scraper" target="_blank"> here.</a></p>


    <h3>Binary to Decimal Converter</h3>

      <p>This project uses C to create a calculator that has all of the same functions as a normal calculator.
        It also includes functions to calculate the factorial of a number as well as binary to decimal/decimal to
        binary conversion. You can find the repository for this project
        <a href="https://github.com/RobertMcMaster/C-Calculator" target="_blank"> here.</a></p>


    <h3>Binary Tree Visualizer</h3>

      <p> This project uses java and a JFrame to create an interactive binary tree.
        The user can input any set of numbers and the program will correctly display
        what the tree should look like. The program also displays the size and depth of
        the tree. You can see how this project was implemented by checking out the
        repository <a href="https://github.com/RobertMcMaster/Binary-Tree-Visualizer" target="_blank">
        here.</a></p>


    <h3>Custom Website</h3>

      <p> This project is the implementation of my own personal website. I built off an
        baseline Netlify framework and then added my own features through the use of HTML5
        and Javascript, and then deployed the website through Netlify. You can find the repository
        <a href="https://github.com/RobertMcMaster/custom-website" target="_blank">
        here.</a></p>


    <h3>Brute Force Algorithm</h3>

      <p> This program uses the brute force algorithm to scan a piece of given text for
        a phrase that the user inputs and then returns its position to the user if a match
        is found. The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/RobertMcMaster/BruteForceAlgorithm" target="_blank">
        here.</a></p>


    <h3>Riemann-Sum Calculator</h3>

      <p>This program calculates the reimman sum of a given coordinates of a graph.
        This program will take user input and then calculate the area under the given
        coordinates of the graph and then will also display the graph that the user entered.
        The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/RobertMcMaster/Riemann-Sum-Calculator" target="_blank">
        here.</a></p>


    <h3>Is Prime Calculator</h3>

      <p>Program that takes a given file of integers and calculates whether each given
        number is prime or composite then displays the results to the user in the terminal.
        The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/RobertMcMaster/isPrime" target="_blank">
        here.</a></p>


    <h3>Black Jack game</h3>

      <p>Using Java, me and my partners successfully implemented a blackjack game.
        The program consists of various classes that each execute a certain aspect
        of the game. You can see how this project was implemented by checking
        out the repository <a href="https://github.com/RobertMcMaster/custom-website" target="_blank">
        here.</a> </p>


    <h3>Python Calculator</h3>

      <p>Using Python, I created a calculator that can be executed through a user's terminal.
        It is capable of executing all basic operations as well as calculating the remainder.
        The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/RobertMcMaster/pythonCalculator" target="_blank">
        here.</a></p>
