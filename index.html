    <p>Hey, my name is Robert McMaster and I am from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I am
      currently enrolled at Allegheny College, where I am pursing a degree in computer
      science and a minor in history. I am proficient in Java, python and C. I also
      have experience in HTML\CSS and R. My computer science interests include data
      management/analysis and cybersecurity. After graduating from Allegheny, I will be
      attending graduate school at Duquense University to puruse a Masters Degree in
      Analytics and Information Management. In my free time I enjoy watching sports, working out,
      and hanging out with friends.</p>

    <p>The goal of this website is to display my professional and personal interests in
      a unique and visually appealing way. Here you can find my work and education experience,
