    <p>Hey, my name is Robert McMaster and I am from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I am
      currently enrolled at Allegheny College, where I am pursing a degree in computer
      science and a minor in history. I am proficient in Java, python and C, and I also
      have experience in HTML\CSS and R. My computer science interests include data
      management/analysis and cybersecurity. After College, I plan on continuing to expand
      my knowledge on these fields by attending graduate school. In my free time I enjoy
      watching sports, working out, playing videogames, and hanging out with friends.</p>

    <p>The goal of this website is to display my professional and personal interests in
      a unique and visually appealing way. Here you can find my work and education experience,
      as well as projects I have completed.</p>
