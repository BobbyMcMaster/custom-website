  ## Robert McMaster

Hey there, my name is Robert McMaster and I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I am currently enrolled at Allegheny College, where I am pursing a degree in computer science with a minor in history. My computer science interests include informational security policy and management, back end development, and data analysis. In my free time, when I'm not playing with computers, I'm watching sports, working out, playing videogames, or just hanging out with friends.

The goal of this website is to display my professional and personal interests in a unique and visually appealing way. Here you can find my work and education experience, as well as highlights from the various video games I play. I hope you enjoy!
